This project proposes a production order management and scheduling software system to improve efficiency in handling vendor orders and daily production tasks. The system will provide a centralized platform to manage vendor and order information, eliminating redundancy in manual entry processes. A calendar-based feature will support task scheduling and workload management while including a feature that ensures unique order requirements are met. The system will also include a reporting feature to generate summaries of vendor interactions and order activity, assisting businesses in continuing to provide services to specific vendors and customers. By integrating these features into a single software tool, businesses can expect to reduce errors, streamline workflows, save resources, and improve overall productivity.
